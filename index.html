      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>This project is a collection free games you can play with your family. Simply get one device and screen share it to a big screen. Each game has different concepts. Some games you may pass the device around and some you play on white boards with the big screen being the information. Ditch the sand timer and the paper cards you need to play at a table with and sit back on your couch and play from your seat. </br> </br> <strong><u>All designed by Brendan Denzel.</u></strong></p>
